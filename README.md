# text-to-image-gradio
A lightweight Gradio demo that generates images from text prompts using Hugging Face's Stable Diffusion pipeline. Ideal for exploring generative AI with minimal setup. Best with GPU; CPU runs are slower. No fine-tuning—just a simple interface to test text-to-image capabilities with open-source tools.
